# Progress: Python Supervisor Process

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Initial Planning and Setup

The Python Supervisor Process with MCP integration is in its initial planning and documentation phase. We are establishing the foundation for development with the memory bank documentation and preparing to begin implementation.

## What Works

As the project is in its initial phase, the following components are in progress:

1. **Project Documentation** ✅
   - Memory bank structure created
   - Core architectural decisions documented
   - MCP service requirements defined

2. **Development Environment** 🔄
   - Initial setup in progress
   - Tools and dependencies identified

## What's Left to Build

### Core Functionality

1. **Process Manager** 📝
   - Process monitoring
   - Process start/restart functionality
   - Process output capture and routing
   - Error handling for processes

2. **File Manager** 📝
   - File reading functionality
   - File writing/editing capabilities
   - Diff-based modifications
   - File search integration with ripgrep

3. **Version Control Manager** 📝
   - Git commit operations
   - Git restore functionality
   - Git status checking
   - Error handling for Git operations

### MCP Service Layer

1. **MCP Server Setup** 📝
   - Basic server implementation
   - Transport protocol integration
   - Authentication and security

2. **MCP Services** 📝
   - `restart_task` service

   - Configuration options
   - API reference
   - Usage examples

2. **Deployment** 📝
   - Package creation
   - Distribution mechanism
   - Docker container (optional)

## Known Issues

As the project is in the planning phase, no implementation issues have been encountered yet. Anticipated challenges include:

1. **Process Management Complexity**
   - Handling various process termination scenarios
   - Ensuring proper cleanup on unexpected exits

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Differences in process handling between operating systems
   - Path handling variations

3. **MCP Protocol Integration**
   - Ensuring proper error propagation
   - Handling large file contents efficiently

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Project setup and documentation
- Core module structure
- Basic tests

### Phase 2: Core Components
- Process Manager implementation
- Basic File Manager functionality
- Simple MCP service structure

### Phase 3: Feature Completion

## Recent Achievements

- Initialized memory bank documentation
- Defined MCP service capabilities
- Established architectural patterns
- Created project technical context
- Fixed MCP server implementation error (stream handling)
- Fixed process manager output handling to prevent start_task command from hanging
- Updated MCP server port configuration to avoid port conflicts
- Successfully tested the start_task MCP tool functionality
- Implemented process decoupling to ensure child processes survive supervisor termination
- Enhanced process termination to properly handle decoupled process groups
- Added port-based process discovery to find and attach to existing processes
- Implemented environment configuration for target process port detection
- Fixed process output handling in ProcessManager to prevent start_task MCP tool from hanging:
  - Replaced blocking readline() calls with a thread pool executor approach
  - Used asyncio.run_in_executor() to perform I/O operations without blocking the event loop
  - Successfully tested with the supervisor managing external processes
- Fixed critical bug in process restart functionality:
  - Added force_new_process parameter to ProcessManager.start() to ensure restart creates a new process
  - Resolved an issue where restart would incorrectly attach to the still-shutting-down process
  - Updated all restart paths to use this parameter for consistent behavior
  - This ensures reliable restart operations without process ID confusion
- Enhanced process termination functionality:
  - Added verification methods to confirm process termination and port release
  - Implemented special handling for attached processes to ensure proper cleanup
  - Added port verification to ensure ports are released after process termination
  - Implemented more aggressive cleanup for processes that fail to terminate gracefully
  - Improved error handling and reporting for process termination failures

## Next Targets

1. Complete development environment setup
2. Implement basic Process Manager functionality
3. Create initial MCP server structure
4. Begin File Manager implementation

## Blockers and Dependencies

No significant blockers identified at this time.

### Dependencies to Resolve
- Finalize decision on MCP transport protocol
- Determine specific process monitoring approach
- Decide on error handling strategy
